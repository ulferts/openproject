# For the sake of this coding exercise, a company is a very simple structure that only has
# * an id
# * a name
# * a single owner
#
# The owner is a User object that already exists in OpenProject. Consequently, there are also
# representers already available for rendering a user (API::V3::Users::UserRepresenter).
#
# The company can also belong to one or many different companies. This is expressed by a parent
# company having a share in a child company. For the sake of simplicity a share is binary. A company
# either has a share in another company or not. There is no representation of a ratio on how much
# of the child company is owned by a parent company. However, a share can be inactive (because this is
# an example).
#
# The resource should include:
# * The id
# * The name
# * The actual users owning the company
#
# The first two are straight forward. The later however requires some explanation. For the sake of this
# example, the set of owning users are those users, that are owners of companies, which are parents
# (or any ancestor) to the company being represented. Those owners than overrule any owner directly
# linked to the represented company. This overruling takes place on every level of ancestry.
#
# E.g. In a set of companies
#
# grandparent - (owner A)
# parent - (owner B)
# child - (owner C)
#
# the owning user of child is A.
#
# To complicate matters, that overruling only takes place if the share is active. So in the example above,
# with the share between parent and grandparent not being active, the owning user of child would be B.
#
# If a company has no parent or only has parents on inactive shares, the owning user is the user of the company.
# Referring to the example again, if the share between child and parent were to be inactive (or to not exist
# at all), the owning user of child would be C.
#
# Since a company can have multiple parents, there can also be multiple owning users
#
# E.g. in a set of companies
#
#                                  grandgrandparent 1 (parent to grandparent 2) - (owner A)
# grandparent 1 - (owner B)        grandparent 2 - (owner C)
#                  parent - (owner D)
#                  child - (owner E)
#
# assuming that every share is active, the owning users of child would be A and B.
